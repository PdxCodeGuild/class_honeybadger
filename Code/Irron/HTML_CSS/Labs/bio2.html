    <h2>  History   </h2>
    <p> Octavia Estelle Butler, often referred to as the "grand dame of science fiction," was born in Pasadena, California on June 22, 
        1947.She received an Associate of Arts degree in 1968 from Pasadena Community College, and also attended California State 
        University in Los Angeles and the University of California, Los Angeles. During 1969 and 1970, she studied at the Screenwriter's 
        Guild Open Door Program and the Clarion Science Fiction Writers' Workshop, where she took a class with science fiction master 
        Harlan Ellison (who later became her mentor), and which led to Butler selling her first science fiction stories. </p> 

    <p> Butler's first story, "Crossover," was published in the 1971 Clarion anthology. Patternmaster, her first novel and the first 
        title of her five-volume Patternist series, was published in 1976, followed by Mind of My Mind in 1977. Others in the series 
        include Survivor (1978), Wild Seed (1980), which won the James Tiptree Award, and Clay's Ark (1984). </p>

    <p> With the publication of Kindred in 1979, Butler was able to support herself writing full time. She won the Hugo Award in 1984 
        for her short story, "Speech Sounds," and in 1985, Butler's novelette "Bloodchild" won a Hugo Award, a Nebula Award, the 
        Locus Award, and an award for best novelette from Science Fiction Chronicle. </p>

    <p> Other books by Octavia E. Butler include the Xenogenesis trilogy: Dawn (1987), Adulthood Rites (1988) and Imago (1989), 
        and a short story collection, Bloodchild and Other Stories (1995). Parable of the Sower (1993), the first of her Earthseed 
        series, was a finalist for the Nebula Award as well as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. The book's sequel, 
        Parable of the Talents (1998), won a Nebula Award. </p>

    <p> In 1995 Butler was awarded a prestigious MacArthur Foundation fellowship.
