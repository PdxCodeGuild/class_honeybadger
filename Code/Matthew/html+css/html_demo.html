    <p>What do they got in there? King Kong? God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.</p>
    <p>Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? You really think you can fly that thing? Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? I was part of something special. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!<p>
