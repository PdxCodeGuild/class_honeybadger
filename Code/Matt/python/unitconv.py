# # Ask the user for the number of feet, and print out the equivalent distance in meters. Hint: 1 ft is 0.3048 m. So we can get the output in meters by multiplying the input distance by 0.3048. Below is some sample input/output.
# feet_conversion = 0.3048
# miles_conversion = 1609.34
# unit_type = input("What is the unit type:(feet, miles, meters, and kilometers.)")
# if unit_type == "feet" or "ft":
#     number_of_feet = float(input("Enter the amount of feet: "))
#     feet_to_meters = feet_conversion * number_of_feet
#     print(f"There are: {feet_to_meters} meters in {number_of_feet} miles!")
# elif unit_type == "miles":
#     number_of_miles = float(input("How many total miles: "))
#     miles_to_meters = miles_conversion * number_of_miles
#     print(f"There are:{miles_to_meters} meters in {number_of_miles} miles!")
