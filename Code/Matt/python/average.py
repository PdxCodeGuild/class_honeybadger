# We're going to average a list of numbers. Start with the following list, iterate through it, keeping a 'running sum', then divide that sum by the number of elements in that list. Remember len will give you the length of a list.

# total = 0
# for num in nums:
#     total += num
# print(total)
#
# user_list = []
# n = int(input("How many numbers do you have? "))
# print("Awesome what are your numbers?")
#
# for i in range (0,n):
#     ele = int(input())
#
#     user_list.append(ele)
# total = 0
# for num in user_list:
#     total += num
#
# average = total / len(user_list)
# print(average)
